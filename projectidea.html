<h2>Project Idea - Learning Japanese through RPG</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>My IT project centres around the idea of learning Japanese through the gameplay of a simple puzzle RPG, where users are forced to memorize and utilize new words in various puzzles to progress through the world and develop their vocabulary through memorization and repetition. Users will be able to learn words and terms by interacting with various NPCs or interacting with the environment. The game would be incredibly simple, so that both young and old people can play without needing previous gaming experience.</p>
<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>My motivation behind this idea stems from Theodosiou (2017) who states that “Australia had "significantly fallen behind" other countries in language education”. In my opinion, learning a new language is incredibly important- even if it’s just the basics. For many, Australians are known for being quite racist or ignorant of other cultures. However by learning new languages, you expose yourself to the culture of that language! I’ve chosen to present my idea as a game as it may be easier for those who are intimidated by the idea of learning a new language or are tired of the textbook approach.</p>
<h3>Description</h3>
<img src="images/beepy.PNG" alt="beepy"/>
<p>At the beginning of the game, players play as a space robot named Beepy who is sent by aliens to learn about human culture in a small Japanese town. This allows those who are completely new to Japanese to project themselves onto Beepy who is controlled with typical WASD controls.
    To navigate through the world, players must interact with the environment by reading notes or talking to NPCs where they will learn the basic Japanese alphabet, Hiragana. Beepy will store the information she learns in her ‘database’ which will act as a makeshift dictionary/notebook for players to refer to when needed.
    Various types of puzzles will block Beepy’s path and the player will need to use the knowledge they’ve gained to solve these. Puzzles such as choosing the door with the correct Hiragana character or reading a word and inp	utting its correct meaning in text. Players may also need to pay close attention to important cultural trivia and mannerisms to talk to certain NPCs. For example, if Beepy wants to talk to an elderly man, she is given various action choices like ‘Bow’, ‘Shake hands’ or ‘Do nothing’; with the correct choice being ‘Bow’ to get the elderly man to talk. </p>
<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
<p>I intend on using various tools and technologies such as programs similar to Unity and RPG maker to build the foundation of the game upon. I’d like to utilize programs like Blender or pixel art programs to help create various game assets such as the environment and characters.</p>
<h3>Skills required</h3>
<p>Skills required to develop this project would be a solid knowledge of Java and/or C# to program the game mechanics such as the puzzles and how the player interacts with the environment, how games incorporate their narratives and knowledge of basic Japanese. The tools I’d be using are easily obtainable through the internet however the skills needed to implement them will be difficult as I will have to learn how to work the program. As a non-native speaker, there is a problem concerning the accuracy in the game’s main focal point; the Japanese language. Words and sentences may come off as unnatural to native speakers but I intend on having a native speaker proofread my work to ensure it is correct. </p>
<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>I don’t expect people to come out of playing this game with a deep understanding of the Japanese language but I do hope they feel inspired to further their studies through other means and immerse themselves in other cultures. I’d also like for more people to view games as an appropriate medium for teaching, as it’s able to provide an immersive and engaging method of learning.</p>
