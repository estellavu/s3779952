         <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
         <h3>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?</h3>
         <p>
            My interest in IT piqued during high school, when I chose IT as an elective during year 10. Unlike those mandatory IT classes in year 7, this elective pushed me to explore the endless possibilities IT had to offer beyond operating Word or Movie Maker. I became enamored with things such as flash games and web development, and discovered the many ways IT could be used for creative purposes.
         </p>
         <h3>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</h3>
         <p>
            Having an encouraging teacher and friends who were just as passionate about IT really pushed me to learn even more and kept me motivated. My first time working in a team on a project was when I participated in a LEGO robotics school competition, which had us working in groups to program a LEGO cart. Although it was intimidating to work with total strangers, I found the experience to be enjoyable nevertheless as the drive to win gave us a common goal and brought us together. 
         </p>
         <h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
         <p>
            I heard about RMIT’s infamous reputation of having a well-structured IT course and top of the line facilities. I’m also impressed with their wide range of connections to various companies and organisations. But more importantly, their CBD campus location is extremely convenient as I value my time, I’d rather spend my time working on projects than to travel for long periods back and forth from campus.
         </p>
         <h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
         <p>
            While I do want to improve upon my technical skills in programming, I also want to push myself to becoming an amazing team member. Teamwork is such a vital component to working in IT, doing team projects is inevitable. I am a painfully shy individual, however I want to work on overcoming this obstacle for both my sake and my team member’s. There’s nothing more frustrating than a member who can’t clearly communicate with their team, I can attest to that from personal experience.
